Let me re-read: \"the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\"\n\nBut looking at the pattern:\n- i=1: 1 (sum, and 1 is odd)\n- i=2: 2 (factorial, and 2 is even)\n- i=3: 6 (factorial, but 3 is odd) - wait, 3! = 6, but 3 is odd\n- i=4: 24 (factorial, 4 is even)\n- i=5: 15 (sum, 5 is odd)\n\nActually, i=3 gives 6 which is 3!, not the sum 6. The sum 1+2+3=6 and 3!=6 happen to be the same for i=3.\n\nLet me check i=1: sum = 1, factorial = 1 - same value\ni=",

For numbers with the same digit sum, maintain their original relative order (stable sort)\n\nLet me trace through the example:\n- `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]`\n- 1: digit sum = 1\n- 11: digit sum = 1+1 = 2  \n- -1: digit sum = 1 (ignore negative sign)\n- -11: digit sum = 1+1 = 2\n- -12: digit sum = 1+2 = 3\n\nSo the digit sums are: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n\nSorting by digit sum (and maintaining original order for ties):\n- Digit sum 1: -1 (index 2), 1 (index 0) \u2192 but we need to maintain original relative order, so 1 comes before -1\n- Digit sum 2: 11 (index 1), -11 (index 3) \u2192 11 comes before -11\n- Digit sum 3: -12 (index 4)\n\nWait, let me check the expected output: `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`\n\nThis gives digit sums: 1, 2, 1, 3, 2\n\nThat doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate...\n\nActually, let me re-read. The expected output is `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`.\n\nLooking at the digit sums:\n- -1: sum = 1\n- -11: sum = 2  \n- 1: sum = 1\n- -12: sum = 3\n- 11: sum = 2\n\nSo we have: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]\n\nThe numbers with sum 1 are -1 and 1. In the original list, 1 is at index 0 and -1 is at index 2, so 1 should come before -1. But in the expected output, -1 comes before 1.\n\nLet me check if there's a different interpretation. Maybe the function name \"order_by_points\" suggests something",
